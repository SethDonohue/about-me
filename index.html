As a developer, I want to use thoughtful and descriptive console.log() throughout my code to help test my work and assist with debugging.
As a prospective job seeker, I want to consider adopting additional features that I have seen in the 'About Me' projects made by others, so that my 'About Me' can become more thorough and interesting than my original conception.
As a prospective job seeker, I was to use CSS to creatively and tastefully style and layout my page.

    <section>
      <p> I am a creative hands-on engineer with a big picture approach to life, but a detail oriented approach to life's challenges. I chose to follow the hands-on engineering path with a degree in Plastics Engineering and Vehicle design from Western Washintong University in 2009.</p>
      <p> At the end of 2015 I took a break from the working world to travel the real world while gathering a new focus on what I'd like to spend my life doing. After almost 2 years of exploring different lands and different cultures I returned to Seattle to develop a new lifestyle and to find a career that would eventually match with that lifestyle.</p>
